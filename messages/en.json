LivQuiz offers a limited feature set and web site experience for young users of LivQuiz. We do not require students to submit their name or contact information, nor do we require them to create accounts. When a student indicates that they are under the age when they can grant consent on their own, LivQuiz does not collect personal information as defined under COPPA and may take additional steps to safeguard student privacy as required by law.

        "parentsText": "LivQuiz empowers parents and legal guardians of children younger than the age of consent (in the U.S., this means under 13) who have registered accounts with LivQuiz to exercise their legal rights pursuant to legislation such as COPPA. Parents/guardians can consent to collection and use by LivQuiz of a child's personally identifiable information (PII) without consenting to the disclosure of information to third parties by LivQuiz. Currently, the only personal information we collect from a child younger than 13 is their parent's or guardian's email address. Parents/guardians may delete, modify, and review information their children shared with LivQuiz by accessing their child's account. They may also create a parent account to manage their child's access to LivQuiz. Parents may also request that LivQuiz delete that information and refuse to allow LivQuiz to collect further information from their children by contacting us at privacy@livquiz.com. LivQuiz may ask additional questions or take other steps to verify the identity of parents/guardians before responding to a request to review or delete their child's information, or a request to refuse further collection from children. LivQuiz will never require a child to share more information than is reasonably necessary for using LivQuiz. While LivQuiz will assign persistent identifiers to all LivQuiz users to recognize repeat visitors and improve their LivQuiz experience, LivQuiz does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children younger than the age of consent without a parent or guardian's consent. If we become aware, despite our intention not to gather this information, that we collected personally identifiable information from a child younger than the age of consent without permission then we will either delete this information or seek to obtain verifiable parental consent from the child's parent or guardian to collect and use that data to provide the child with LivQuiz services in the future.",

        "collectText": "The information that LivQuiz collects depends on the nature of the services you request. For example, fewer data are collected from a student joining a game without an account than from a teacher who creates an account in order to create quizzes and host games. All interactions with the LivQuiz website or app produce metadata that may identify you or could be identifiable information when paired with other information about you. In every case, LivQuiz strives to collect only the minimum necessary information from you as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with LivQuiz or that is required by law. Visitors to the LivQuiz website or app may always refuse to supply personally identifying information, however, doing so may prevent you from engaging in certain website-related activities.",
